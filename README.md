Level Prusa i3 heatbed for ABS prints

1) Run this gcode

2) Printer heats to 255 °C / 110 °C (that+s how I print

3) Printer goes to 0;0;0.1 mm

4) Use positioning buttons and feeler gauge to level the bed

This works for my printer. Other printers are untested and may be destroyed. Also it may set your house on fire and kill the cat.
